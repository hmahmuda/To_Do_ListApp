# To_Do_ListApp
This project is a desktop-based To-Do List application developed using Java (Swing GUI) in Apache NetBeans. The application helps users efficiently manage daily tasks through an interactive and user-friendly interface.
📖 Project Overview

The Java To-Do List Application allows users to add, manage, and track their daily tasks.
It is built following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and modular design structure.

The application includes advanced features such as:

Due Date & Time selection

Task Priority Levels (High, Medium, Low)

Reminder/Notification mechanism

Mark task as completed

Delete tasks

This project demonstrates practical implementation of Java Swing, Event Handling, and OOP concepts.

🚀 Features

✔ Add new tasks
✔ Delete tasks
✔ Mark tasks as completed
✔ Assign priority (High / Medium / Low)
✔ Set due date and time
✔ Reminder/Alert system
✔ User-friendly GUI
✔ Modular class structure
